# Documentation of this repository

To build the documentation, just run (note `sphinx` needs to be [installed](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html))

```console
$ make html
```

To open the documentation just open the file [index.html](docs/html/index.html) in your browser.

**Note, `sphinx` has been retrospectively build into this repository, such that not all docstrings might be parsed correctly.**
