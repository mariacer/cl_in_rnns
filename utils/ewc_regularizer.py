    r"""Compute estimates of the diagonal elements of the Fisher information
    matrix, as needed as importance-weights by elastic weight consolidation
    (EWC).

    Note, this method registers buffers in the given module (storing the
    current parameters and the estimate of the Fisher diagonal elements), i.e.,
    the "mnet" if "hnet" is None, otherwise the "hnet".

    Args:
        task_id: The ID of the current task, needed to store the computed
            tensors with a unique name. When "hnet" is given, it is used as
            input to the "hnet" forward method to select the current task
            embedding.
        data: A data handler. We will compute the Fisher estimate across the
            whole training set (except ``n_max`` is specified).
        params: A list of parameter tensors from the module of which we aim to
            compute the Fisher for. If ``hnet`` is given, then these are assumed
            to be the "theta" parameters, that we pass to the forward function
            of the hypernetwork. Otherwise, these are the "weights" passed to
            the forward method of the main network.
            Note, they might not be detached from their original parameters,
            because we use ``backward()`` on the computational graph to read out
            the ``.grad`` variable.
            Note, the order in which these parameters are passed to this method
            and the corresponding EWC loss function must not change, because
            the index within the "params" list will be used as unique
            identifier.
        device: Current PyTorch device.
        mnet: The main network. If ``hnet`` is ``None``, then ``params`` are
            assumed to belong to this network. The fisher estimate will be
            computed accordingly.
            Note, ``params`` might be the output of the hypernetwork, i.e.,
            weights for a specific task. In this case, "online"-EWC doesn't make
            much sense, as we don't follow the Bayesian view of using the old
            task weights as prior for the current once. Instead, we have a new
            set of weights for all tasks.
        hnet (optional): If given, ``params`` is assumed to correspond to the
            unconditional weights :math:`\theta` (which does not include, for
            instance, task embeddings) of the hypernetwork. In this case, the
            diagonal Fisher entries belong to weights of the hypernetwork. The
            Fisher will then be computed based on the probability
            :math:`p(y \mid x, \text{task\_id})`, where ``task_id`` is just a
            constant input (representing the corresponding conditional weights,
            e.g., task embedding) in addition to the training samples :math:`x`.
        empirical_fisher: If ``True``, we compute the fisher based on training
            targets. Note, this has to be ``True`` if ``regression`` is set,
            otherwise the squared norm between main network output and
            "most likely" output is always zero, as they are identical.
        online: If ``True``, then we use online EWC, hence, there is only one
            diagonal Fisher approximation and one target parameter value stored
            at the time, rather than for all previous tasks.
        gamma: The gamma parameter for online EWC, controlling the gradual decay
            of previous tasks.
        n_max (optional): If not ``-1``, this will be the maximum amount of
            training samples considered for estimating the Fisher.
        regression: Whether the task at hand is a classification or regression
            task. If ``True``, a regression task is assumed. For simplicity, we
            assume the following probabilistic model
            :math:`p(y \mid x) = \mathcal{N}\big(f(x), I\big)` with :math:`I`
            being the identity matrix. In this case, the only terms of the log
            probability that influence the gradient are:
            :math:`\log p(y \mid x) = \lVert f(x) - y \rVert^2`
        time_series (bool): If ``True``, the output of the main network
            ``mnet`` is expected to be a time series. In particular, we
            assume that the output is a tensor of shape ``[S, N, F]``,
            where ``S`` is the length of the time series, ``N`` is the batch
            size and ``F`` is the size of each feature vector (e.g., in
            classification, ``F`` would be the number of classes).

            Let :math:`\mathbf{y} = (\mathbf{y}_1, \dots \mathbf{y}_S)` be the
            output of the main network. We denote the parameters ``params`` by
            :math:`\theta` and the input by :math:`\mathbf{x}` (which we do not
            consider as random). We use the following decomposition of the
            likelihood
            
            .. math::
                
                p(\mathbf{y} \mid \theta; \mathbf{x}) =
                \prod_{i=1}^S p(\mathbf{y}_i \mid \mathbf{y}_1, \dots,
                \mathbf{y}_{i-1}, \theta; \mathbf{x}_i)

            **Classification:** If
            :math:`f(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{h}_{i-1}, \theta)` denotes the output
            of the main network ``mnet`` for timestep :math:`i` (assuming
            :math:`\mathbf{h}_{i-1}` is the most recent hidden state), we assume

            .. math::

                p(\mathbf{y}_i \mid \mathbf{y}_1, \dots, \mathbf{y}_{i-1},
                \theta; \mathbf{x}_i) \equiv \text{softmax} \big(
                f(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{h}_{i-1}, \theta) \big)

            Hence, we assume that we can write the negative log-likelihood (NLL)
            as follows given a label :math:`t \in [1, \dots, F]^S`:

            .. math::

                \text{NLL} &= - \log p(Y = t \mid \theta; \mathbf{x}) \\
                &= \sum_{i=1}^S - \text{softmax} \big(
                f(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{h}_{i-1}, \theta)_{t_i} \big) \\
                &= \sum_{i=1}^S \text{cross\_entropy} \big(
                f(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{h}_{i-1}, \theta), t_i \big)

            Thus, we simply sum the cross-entropy losses per time-step to
            estimate the NLL, which we then backpropagate through in order to
            compute the diagonal Fisher elements.
        allowed_outputs (optional): A list of indices, indicating which output
            neurons of the main network should be taken into account when
            computing the log probability. If not specified, all output neurons
            are considered.
        custom_forward (optional): A function handle that can replace the
            default procedure of forwarding samples through the given
            network(s).

            The default forward procedure if ``hnet`` is ``None`` is

            .. code:: python

                Y = mnet.forward(X, weights=params)

            Otherwise, the default forward procedure is

            .. code:: python

                weights = hnet.forward(task_id, theta=params)
                Y = mnet.forward(X, weights=weights)

            The signature of this function should be as follows.
                - ``hnet`` is ``None``: :code:`@fun(mnet, params, X)`
                - ``hnet`` is not ``None``:
                  :code:`@fun(mnet, hnet, task_id, params, X)`

            where :code:`X` denotes the input batch to the main network (usually
            consisting of a single sample).

            Example:
                Imagine a situation where the main network uses context-
                dependent modulation (cmp.
                :class:`utils.context_mod_layer.ContextModLayer`) and the
                parameters of these context-mod layers are produced by the
                hypernetwork ``hnet``, whereas the remaining weights of the
                main network ``mnet`` are maintained internally and passed as
                argument ``params`` to this method.

                In particular, we look at a main network that is an instance
                of class :class:`mnets.mlp.MLP`. The forward pass through this
                combination of networks should be handled as follows in order
                to compute the correct fisher matrix:

                .. code:: python

                    def custom_forward(mnet, hnet, task_id, params, X):
                        mod_weights = hnet.forward(task_id)
                        weights = {
                            'mod_weights': mod_weights,
                            'internal_weights': params
                        }
                        Y = mnet.forward(X, weights=weights)
                        return Y
        custom_nll (optional): A function handle that can replace the default 
            procedure of computing the negative-log-likelihood (NLL), which is
            required to compute the Fisher.

            The signature of this function should be as follows:
                :code:`@fun(Y, T, data, allowed_outputs, empirical_fisher)`

            where ``Y`` are the outputs of the main network. Note,
            ``allowed_outputs`` have already been applied to ``Y``, if given.
            ``T`` is the target provided by the dataset ``data``, transformed as
            follows:

            .. code:: python

                T = data.output_to_torch_tensor(batch[1], device,
                                                mode='inference')

            The arguments ``data``, ``allowed_outputs`` and ``empirical_fisher``
            are only passed for convinience (e.g., to apply simple sanity checks
            using assertions).

            The output of the function handle should be the NLL for the given
            sample.
        pass_ids (bool): If a ``custom_nll`` is used and this flag is ``True``,
            then the signature of the ``cutom_nll`` is expected to be:

            .. code:: python

                @fun(Y, T, data, allowed_outputs, empirical_fisher, batch_ids)

            where ``batch_ids`` are the unique identifiers as returned by
            option ``return_ids`` of method
            :meth:`data.dataset.Dataset.next_train_batch` corresponding to the
            provided samples.

            Example:
                In sequential datasets, target sequences ``T`` might be padded
                to the same length. Though, if the unpadded length should be
                used for NLL computation, then the ``custom_nll`` function needs
                the ability to request this information (sequence length) from
                ``data``.

            Also, the signatures of ``custom_forward`` are expected to be
            different.

            The signature of this function should be as follows.

            - ``hnet`` is ``None``: ``@fun(mnet, params, X, data, batch_ids)``
            - ``hnet`` is not ``None``:
              ``@fun(mnet, hnet, task_id, params, X, data, batch_ids)``
